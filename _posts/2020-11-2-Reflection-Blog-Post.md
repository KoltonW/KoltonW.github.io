title: Reflection Blog Post
---

In the time that has passed since my first blog post, not much has changed in the way of my thought process regarding data scientists and what they do. I still believe the main goals for this job are to take data, clean, organize, explore, and analyze it, and create predictive models based off of findings during the data research. This class has shown me how these skills would translate and apply in a job setting. 

I personally very much enjoy R as a tool for data science. I prefer it to other programming methods learned, such as SAS, and could see myself using R going forward. I love the functionality of R Studio to accomplish various tasks, and the abundance of packages to be installed and put to use is a major key as well. Also, using R Markdown to create PDF's is a process I can definitely view myself doing. Overall, I have found exploring data and creating models quite interesting. 

After taking this course, I have a much better feel on the type of work I would want to be doing in a job setting, and how I would implement the skills learned during the course. As of right now, I don't have a way to translate the things I have learned into practice right away, but this course has provided a great base for when I do get the chance to apply my knowledge. I still am very interested in analyzing data and using predictive methods for purposes involving sports, as that is my future goal.
