To me, being a data scientist is about taking large amounts of data, cleaning and analyzing this data through machine learning to derive information, and using that information to accurately create some type of predictive model.  I would say that the main duties of this job would be to retrieve mass amounts of data, organize it in a way that one would find helpful in the process of analyzation, and create models for the future based off of previous findings. Knowledge in areas of statistics, data analysis, and programming seem particularly important to accomplish the job. 

While I do see similarities between the responsibilities of data scientists and statisticians, such as collecting information in order to make assumptions about a topic of interest, it is also important to note the differences. I think of data scientists as more "large-scale", requiring large amounts of data in order to find complex algorithms and predictive models through programming that could have a wide variety of applictions. In opposition, I see statisticians working more with mathematical and statistical methods in a smaller scale that require dealing with uncertainty and probability. To sum it up briefly, I would relate more programming work with data scientists and more of the applied mathematics to statisticians. 

As for myself, I believe I am in the middle between the two fields. I have dealt with many courses in mathematics and statistics and find that my brain works best with numbers. However, I am very interested in becoming a better programmer and using all knowledge from new and previous endeavors to become a data scientist.
